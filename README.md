ReMaster Utility is a Windows based utility for repairing (fixing) heavily copy-protected NIB images and converts to re-writeable G64 files for c64 emulation or for use on real c64 hardware.

Some c64 games use very short synchronization signals that sometimes don't get picked up by the 1541/71 disk drive when reading from original disks and if these sync signals aren't the correct
length or the data becomes bit-shifted from improper framing, the image will not work when in emulators or when written back to disk.  ReMaster Utility will analyze V-Max and Vorpal protected
NIB images and correct the syncing lengths and/or re-frame the track data to it's proper orientation and output a G64 image that will work in an emulator or when written back to disk for use
on a real c64 with 1541/71 disk drive
